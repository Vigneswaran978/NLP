    "\n",
    "* Preprocess the data to a format a neural network can ingest. This is easy: the data is already numerical, so we don't need to do any \n",
    "vectorization. However each timeseries in the data is on a different scale (e.g. temperature is typically between -20 and +30, but \n",
    "pressure, measured in mbar, is around 1000). So we will normalize each timeseries independently so that they all take small values on a \n",
    "similar scale.\n",
    "* Write a Python generator that takes our current array of float data and yields batches of data from the recent past, alongside with a \n",
    "target temperature in the future. Since the samples in our dataset are highly redundant (e.g. sample `N` and sample `N + 1` will have most \n",
    "of their timesteps in common), it would be very wasteful to explicitly allocate every sample. Instead, we will generate the samples on the \n",
    "fly using the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We preprocess the data by subtracting the mean of each timeseries and dividing by the standard deviation. We plan on using the first \n",

    "## Using recurrent dropout to fight overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is evident from our training and validation curves that our model is overfitting: the training and validation losses start diverging \n",
    "considerably after a few epochs. You are already familiar with a classic technique for fighting this phenomenon: dropout, consisting in \n",
    "randomly zeroing-out input units of a layer in order to break happenstance correlations in the training data that the layer is exposed to. \n",
    "How to correctly apply dropout in recurrent networks, however, is not a trivial question. It has long been known that applying dropout \n",
    "before a recurrent layer hinders learning rather than helping with regularization. In 2015, Yarin Gal, as part of his Ph.D. thesis on \n",
    "Bayesian deep learning, determined the proper way to use dropout with a recurrent network: the same dropout mask (the same pattern of \n",
    "dropped units) should be applied at every timestep, instead of a dropout mask that would vary randomly from timestep to timestep. What's \n",
    "more: in order to regularize the representations formed by the recurrent gates of layers such as GRU and LSTM, a temporally constant \n",
    "dropout mask should be applied to the inner recurrent activations of the layer (a \"recurrent\" dropout mask). Using the same dropout mask at \n",
    "every timestep allows the network to properly propagate its learning error through time; a temporally random dropout mask would instead \n",
    "disrupt this error signal and be harmful to the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yarin Gal did his research using Keras and helped build this mechanism directly into Keras recurrent layers. Every recurrent layer in Keras \n",
    "has two dropout-related arguments: `dropout`, a float specifying the dropout rate for input units of the layer, and `recurrent_dropout`, \n",
    "specifying the dropout rate of the recurrent units. Let's add dropout and recurrent dropout to our GRU layer and see how it impacts \n",
    "overfitting. Because networks being regularized with dropout always take longer to fully converge, we train our network for twice as many \n",
    "epochs."

    "## Using bidirectional RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The last technique that we will introduce in this section is called \"bidirectional RNNs\". A bidirectional RNN is common RNN variant which \n",
    "can offer higher performance than a regular RNN on certain tasks. It is frequently used in natural language processing -- you could call it \n",
    "the Swiss army knife of deep learning for NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are notably order-dependent, or time-dependent: they process the timesteps of their input sequences in order, and shuffling or \n",
    "reversing the timesteps can completely change the representations that the RNN will extract from the sequence. This is precisely the reason \n",
    "why they perform well on problems where order is meaningful, such as our temperature forecasting problem. A bidirectional RNN exploits \n",
    "the order-sensitivity of RNNs: it simply consists of two regular RNNs, such as the GRU or LSTM layers that you are already familiar with, \n",
    "each processing input sequence in one direction (chronologically and antichronologically), then merging their representations. By \n",
    "processing a sequence both way, a bidirectional RNN is able to catch patterns that may have been overlooked by a one-direction RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkably, the fact that the RNN layers in this section have so far processed sequences in chronological order (older timesteps first) may \n",
    "have been an arbitrary decision. At least, it's a decision we made no attempt at questioning so far. Could it be that our RNNs could have \n",
    "performed well enough if it were processing input sequences in antichronological order, for instance (newer timesteps first)? Let's try \n",
    "this in practice and see what we get. All we need to do is write a variant of our data generator, where the input sequences get reverted \n",
    "along the time dimension (replace the last line with `yield samples[:, ::-1, :], targets`). Training the same one-GRU-layer network as we \n",
    "used in the first experiment in this section, we get the following results:"
